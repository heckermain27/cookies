     <h3>Instructions</h3>
     <ol type="1">
     <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 375Â°</strong>. Spray the cookie sheet with nonstick spray or you can use a liner. Silicone liners (like silpats) and parchment paper both work very well.</li>
     <li>Mix Together the two sugars. Be sure to break apart ay hard chunks of brown sugar and get two sugars fully mixed. Dark brown sugar has more of a caramel flavor and the ight brown sugar will make your cookies taste a bit sweeter.</li>
     <li>Mix the softened butter into the sugar in globs. This helps really incorporate the butter and the sugar.</li>
     <li>Mix in the eggs one at a time. Crack eggs directly into the bowl with the butter-sugar mix, and use your spoon to lightly beat the eggs before stirring them into the butter and sugar.</li>
